# Spring Boot + RabbitMQ

This repository contains an example application that demonstrates how to use RabbitMQ with Spring Boot. It showcases the setup of RabbitMQ, sending and receiving messages, and handling different types of messages.

## Prerequisites

To run the example application, you need the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Apache Maven

Make sure you have RabbitMQ installed and running on your local machine or have access to a RabbitMQ server.

## Getting Started

To get started with the example application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-boot-rabbitmq-example.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd springboot-rabbitmq
   ```

3. Build the application using Maven:

   ```shell
   mvn clean package
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```shell
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

5. Open your browser and access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows standard Maven conventions:

```
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── java      # Java source files
│   │   └── resources # Resource files (application.properties, etc.)
│   └── test
│       └── java      # Test source files
└── pom.xml           # Maven project configuration
```

The main Java source files are located in the `src/main/java` directory, and the resource files, including the `application.properties` file for RabbitMQ configuration, are located in the `src/main/resources` directory.

## Configuration

The RabbitMQ connection properties are configured in the `application-rabbitmq.properties` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory. Update the properties accordingly to match your RabbitMQ setup:

```properties
# RabbitMQ connection properties
spring.rabbitmq.host=localhost
spring.rabbitmq.port=5672
spring.rabbitmq.username=guest
spring.rabbitmq.password=guest
```

You can customize the properties based on your RabbitMQ server's host, port, username, and password.

## Sending Messages

To send messages to RabbitMQ, you can use the `RabbitTemplate` class provided by Spring AMQP. In the example application, the `MessageProducer` class demonstrates sending messages. You can customize the logic in this class to send messages as per your requirements.

## Receiving Messages

To receive messages from RabbitMQ, you can use the `@RabbitListener` annotation provided by Spring AMQP. In the example application, the `MessageConsumer` class demonstrates receiving messages. You can modify and extend this class to handle different types of messages and perform the necessary processing.

## Custom Message Types

The example application showcases sending and receiving messages of type `String`. If you want to send and receive custom message types, you can create your own POJO (Plain Old Java Object) classes and configure the message converter
